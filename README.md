# 📉 Telco Customer Churn Analysis

This project analyzes customer churn data from a fictional telecom company to identify key drivers of customer attrition. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, machine learning model development, and a Streamlit web application for churn prediction.

---

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Explore and visualize customer churn patterns.
- Build a machine learning model to predict churn.
- Deploy a simple and interactive user interface using Streamlit.

---


## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes customer-level information such as:
- Demographics (e.g., gender, senior citizen)
- Services signed up for (e.g., phone, internet, contract type)
- Account info (e.g., tenure, monthly charges)
- Target: `Churn` (Yes/No)

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`
- Feature engineering & preprocessing with `scikit-learn`
- Machine learning using `LightGBM` (or another classifier)
- Hyperparameter tuning with `Optuna`
- Interactive prediction interface via Streamlit
